So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year

I'll be there for you, ooh-ooh (When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before)
I said, I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too)

You're still in bed at ten
And work began at eight (Stop-stop)
You've burned your breakfast, so far
Things are going great

Your mother warned you there'd be days like these (There'd be days like these)
But she didn't tell you when the world has
Brought you down to your knees and

I'll be there for you, yeah
I'll be there for you, whoo
I'll be there for you
There for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me

Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, oh, yeah, yeah (Ooh, you, ahh, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, you, yeah (Ooh-woo-hoo)

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year

I'll be there for you (When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too)

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
'Cause you're there for me too
