All I need is a TV show
That and my radio
Down on my luck again
Down on my luck again

I can show you,I can show you
Some of the people in my life
I can show you,I can show you
Some of the people in my life

Its driving me mad -Oh!
Its just another way of passing the day
Ow ooh

I,I,I get so lonely when she's not there
I
I
I,I, I,I,I,eeI

Your just another face
Eyes upon my TV show
But I've known you for so very long
Feel like a friend

Could you do when you think of me?
Can I touch you for a while?
Can I meet you on another day when we can fly away?

I can show you,I can show you
Some of the people in my life
(My life,my life?You wouldn't believe it!)

Its driving me mad
Oh its just another way of passing the day .
Ow,ow yeah

Get so lonely when she's not there
I,I,I,I,I yiyiyi

Turn it on
Turn it on
Turn it on again

I SAID,would I be correct in that assumption? Even I need someone to love . Let's face it we ALL need somebody to love.lets put our cards right on the table.
...Well I'll leave you with the immortal words of Jake and Elwood blues and Mr Solomon Burke who personally said to me one day,and he said:

Everybody

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
Someone to squeeze
Someone to please
Someone to love
And we need you,you,you
Yes we need you,you,you

I cant get no,girlie action
'Cause I've tried,tried,tried

Twist and shout (twist and shout)

Well if you feel that you can't go on
Because all your hope you got is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
And happiness is just an illusion
(I know what your thinking)
Your out there on your own,but darling

Reach out

(Hit it)

Ill be there
To love and to comfort you -Listen

To love you and see you through

You never close your eyes like before when I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Your trying hard not to show it (Baby)
But baby,baby I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Woohwooh lost that loving feeling
Bring back that loving feeling
Because its gone,gone,gone

Yeah!

Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Knebworth down to Brighton,I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball
Yeah Yeah

Well I'm going to wait til the midnight hour
Thats when my love comes tumbling down
Yes I'm going to wait til the midnight hour
Thats when there's nobody else around

I'm going take you and hold you
And I'm going to do all those dirty things I told you
Ooh!
Baby in the midnight hour
Oh yeah
Baby in that midnight hour

Sing it!

Turn it on,on,on
Turn it on,turn it on again

Turn it on
Turn it on,turn it on again

Turn it on
Turn it on,turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on
Turn it on
Turn it on

Turn it,turn it,turn it

Turn it on again

(End - I think!)
